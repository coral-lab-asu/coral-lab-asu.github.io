          Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
 driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to
 visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA
 research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a
 limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising
 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types—choropleth maps,
 cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another
 and a humanbaseline. An additional experiment...

          Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data—a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce TEMPTABQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating...

          Tabular reasoning involves interpreting natural language queries about tabular data, which presents a unique challenge of combining language understanding with structured data analysis. Existing methods employ either textual reasoning, which excels in semantic interpretation but struggles with mathematical

           Cognitive textual and visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, series, and analogies, demand
 the ability to quickly reason, decipher, and
 evaluate patterns both textually and spatially.
 Due to extensive training on vast amounts of
 human-curated data, large language models
 (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs)
 excel in common-sense reasoning tasks, but
 still struggle with more complex reasoning
 that demands deeper cognitive understanding.
 We introduce NTSEBENCH, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multimodal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2,728 multiple-choice
 questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, spanning 26 categories....

          Language models, characterized by their black
box nature, often hallucinate and display sensitivity to input perturbations, causing concerns
 about trust. To enhance trust, it is imperative
 to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
 model’s failure modes and develop effective
 strategies to improve their performance. In this
 study, we introduce a methodology designed
 to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including
 pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance
 the model’s robustness to input perturbations.

          Chart question answering (CQA) is a crucial area of Visual Language Understanding. However, the robustness and consistency of current Visual Language Models (VLMs) in this field remain under-explored. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on comprehensive datasets, developed specifically for this study, encompassing diverse question categories and chart formats. We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally,...
